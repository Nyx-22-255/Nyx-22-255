- Hi, I’m Nyx!
- I’m interested in Physics, computation, and machine learning methods, along with game development and music.
- I’m currently learning machine learning (supervised and unsupervised) along with QFT and representation theory.
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving string theory, algebraic topology, and machine learning.
